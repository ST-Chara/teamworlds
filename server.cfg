#sv_motd "Hi you are in blue engineers team. Every engineer starts with laser gun. 5Engineers laser gun can create walls, by shooting it first time to set first end of the wall, and then shooting second time anywhere to set the second point from your position. Each wall has 5 hp. You as an engineer deal 2x damage to yourself (so be careful when rocket boosting). The other team is the team of commandos, which grenade launchers can deal 2x damage to you, and don't deal any damage to themselves. IMPORTANT: Commandos can destroy your walls by shooting any of two ends of it (so place your wall ends in hard to shoot points). Please enjoy my class mod (made by Silent). "
