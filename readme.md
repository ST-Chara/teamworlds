# Engineer
Engineer is a defensive class capable of building and maintaining defenses. He spawns with laser gun. 
Its special ability is placing force fields (walls) using laser gun.
To place wall you have to do: 
1. Shoot first time set first point of the wall (tip: after shooting first time you will see preview of wall)
2. And then shoot anywhere another time to set second point

To remove wall just stand close to any of ends of wall and shoot anywhere with your pistol

Force field's durability gets diminished when enemies fires on it, or when it deals damage to the enemies. 
If the force field's durability reaches zero, it triggers an explosion on both ends, possibly harming the defenders.

Engineers can repair the forcefield by hitting one of its ends with the hammer. This process adds hitpoints to the forcefield. until the number 
reaches the maximum value of 5. <maybe more? 10?>

Engineer is capable of deploying a single force field without re-arming. To re-arm an engineer has to pick up a Laser Gun from anywhere in the map.

A friendly force field can be picked up by the engineer. A picked up force field will replenish a Laser ammo, effectively allowing the Engineer to
move the forcefield easily. To pick up the force field, and Engineer has to come to one of its ends, and fire his pistol anywhere (the bullet's direction does not matter).

Each engineer can simultaneously have no more, than <5> active force fields.
